This will go over the basics of the web, it tries to assume you're a beginner with little experience.

## What is the web?

The web, or the internet, is a bunch of computers that continuously send out information. This could be information about the weather, your bank account, or twitter. Behind each one is a computer that runs a program to send that information to you. These computers are called servers, while you (or your browser specifically) is the client.

<br />

So from a high level we can think we typically have two 'realms', the servers which is often referenced as the backend. And the clients which is often referenced as the frontend.

## Frontend and clients
