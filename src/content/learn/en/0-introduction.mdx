This will go over the basics of the web, it tries to assume you're a beginner with little experience.

# What is the web?

The web, or the internet, is a bunch of computers that continuously send out information. This could be information about the weather, your bank account, or twitter. Behind each one is a computer that runs a program to send that information to you. These computers are called servers, while you (or your browser specifically) is the client.

<br />

So from a high level we can think we typically have two 'realms', the servers which is often referenced as the backend. And the clients which is often referenced as the frontend.

# Frontend and clients

The realm in which everyone is already familiar with is the frontend or the client. This is Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, etc... When you go to google.com, howsit.dev, or any other website, you are the client. This can be from a computer, a phone, a tablet, or many other forms of devices. If you think about it, the page you recieve from google and How's It is completely different. Underneath, they are both just made out of three programming languages; HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We'll go over these in more detail later, but for now you can closly associate what the client sees/does (the text on the screen, the color of the background, the buttons you can click) with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Backend and servers

The realm that's foriegn, even to many developers, is the backend or the server. Somehow google.com sends you over your search results for your client to display them. It's not like everyone's computer knows about these search results, they are always retrieved from the servers. Even when the page is initially loaded, the code that makes up that page was sent by a server. You can think a server's main job is to send either code or data to the client. It will send code such that it will display on the client's screen or it will send data that the client can read and create it's own code from.

# What does this mean for me?

Some developers choose frontend, backend, or "full-stack" (both). This can help narrow down what they need to learn to kick the ground running (but eventually it's ideal to understand both in great detail). If you like dealing with visual elements more, you can search up tutorials in Vanilla JS (more on learning paths in a future article). If you like dealing with what is traditionally more 'programming' you can search up tutorials in Node.js (Express.js as well). You can jump in to both, but it may blur the lines between the client and server in the beginning; that being said a lot of developers, including myself, jumped in to both first.

# Some key terms

-   **Program** - Some code, a set of instructions that computers can understand
-   **Runtime** - A program that runs code. The browser is a runtime for JavaScript, but the server has many runtimes for many languages.

## Frontend related

-   **Frontend** - The client, the browser, the visual elements of a website
-   **HTML** - "HyperText Markup Language", the structure of a website
-   **CSS** - "Cascading Style Sheets", the style of a website
-   **JavaScript** - The language that provides interactivity in the web
-   **Browser** - A program designed to view websites. It displays HTML, styles the HTML with CSS, and runs JavaScript (for clients)

## Backend related

-   **Backend** - The server, the data, the program that sends data to the client
-   **JavaScript** - The language that provides interactivity in the web
-   **Node.js** - A runtime for JavaScript for servers
