First off, a programming language is a language that computers can understand. You can think of them as a specific set of instructions that computers can follow. Often, we try to pick the best language for the job when beginning a project. And we usually take it a step further with picking the best tools in that language for the job. In web development, we always have HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Often, it's complicated to write websites in purely these three, so we use a different language that generates the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for us.

# Needed languages

<div class="flex gap-2">
    <Icon
        src="HTML"
        class="mt-2"
    />
    <span class="text-xl font-bold text-html">HTML</span> is the main code of the
    web. It is the markup language that provides the skeleton to all websites.
</div>

<div class="flex gap-2">
    <Icon
        src="CSS"
        class="mt-2"
    />
    <span class="text-xl font-bold text-css">CSS</span> is the design of the web.
    It is a language that gives elements their color, width, shadows, and more.
</div>

<div class="flex gap-2">
    <Icon
        src="JavaScript"
        class="mt-2"
    />
    <span class="text-xl font-bold text-js">JavaScript</span> (or JS) is the language
    of the web, it's the main language in which browsers like Chrome can run code
    for sites.
</div>

# Additional languages

<div class="flex gap-2">
    <Icon
        src="TypeScript"
        class="mt-2"
    />
    <span class="text-xl font-bold text-ts">TypeScript</span> (or TS) is a superset
    of JavaScript that introduces types in to the language. Types help catch bugs
    and speed up development.
</div>

<span class="text-xl font-bold text-jsdoc">JSDoc</span>
is a recent alternative to TypeScript that allows for annotations to be added to
JavaScript code, to give type inference. It isn't technically a language as it is
just used on top of JavaScript.
